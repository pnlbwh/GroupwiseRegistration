Registrations: 1) demons, 2) FEM, 3) Bspline

Demons: (technically means local deformations of each pixel)

1. intensity values must be the same, it must have the same intensity distribution.
2. transition regions smoothe, low frequency.  Don't want large difference between vectors of neighbouring pixels 
3. Uses Gaussian smoothing as regularization

local deformations in order of intensity transition
